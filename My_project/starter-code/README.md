# React App & Express API with Authentication

### Introduction

Your task is to take the `starter-code` provided, and build out an Express API, and a React app that consumes it.

The `starter-code` includes a Webpack setup and a simple Express API, but you will need to build out the rest of the API, before starting the React app.

### Requirements

#### Part One - Express API

It has been a little while since you've built out an Express API, so as practice before you start your final projects, we want you to build out an authenticated Express API with **two** models - a `User` model, and another model **of your choice**.

* A `User` model (a basic user model has been added for you, but you may want to add fields)
* A second resource of your choice that is **fully RESTful**
* You should link the two models, i.e there should be a reference to a user inside your second model

**Important:** Test your API in Insomnia first before moving on to part two

#### Part Two - React App

* Users should be able to login and register
* Your second resource should be **fully RESTful**
* A user should only be able to see the **Edit** and **Delete** buttons if they created the resource

## Bonus

* Add form validations
* Add sorting/filtering with Lodash
* Add a third model such as `Comment`
